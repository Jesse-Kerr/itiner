1. For one of visit_a_city's itineraries for one of its cities, get a list of places it has.
2. Get coordinates for each place using GMaps api
3. Do a quick bit of plotting/ mapping
4. Figure out how to calculate distances between coordinates
5. Solve traveling salesman problem. Use a couple algorithms and come up with a best route
6. Figure out how to add in the wait-times data to the calculation
7. Calculate best daily routes with wait times
8. Profit
